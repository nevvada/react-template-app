# React Template App

### Background

The inspiration to this project was the need to be able to quickly prototype a React application or project with more config flexibility than whats offered with Create-React-App. It's a very minimal template, allowing for easy customization without the headache.

### Features

- A Node/Express.js server
- Webpack to bundle code, provided with HMR and scripts for development, production, and testing
- Jest & Enzyme testing suites
- Babel for transpiling code

then...

`$ npm run dev`

or

`$ npm run build`
